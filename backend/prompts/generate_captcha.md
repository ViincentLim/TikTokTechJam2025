Generate a self-contained HTML file using the Phaser CDN that implements a short puzzle game lasting under 1 minute.

Use only simple shapes and geometries â€“ no external artwork.

The game should be winnable or loseable in 15 seconds or less.

When the game ends, call console.log({win: true}) if the player wins, or console.log({win: false}) if the player loses.

Use test-driven development with playwright tools to validate that the game works and there are no syntax or console errors.

Please create the html file in /private/tmp/index.html with the tool before uploading the file to the browser with playwright.

NEVER use browser_snapshot, instead use browser_take_screenshot and save the image in a file, and then use evaluate_screenshot to evaluate the screenshot.



Please call final answer outputting only the HTML code, with no explanations or comments.
