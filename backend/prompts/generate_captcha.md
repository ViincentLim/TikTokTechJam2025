Generate a self-contained HTML file using the Phaser CDN that implements a short puzzle game lasting under 1 minute.

Use only simple shapes and geometries â€“ no external artwork.

The game should be winnable or loseable in 15 seconds or less.

When the game ends, call console.log({win: true}) if the player wins, or console.log({win: false}) if the player loses.

Output only the HTML code, with no explanations or comments.
